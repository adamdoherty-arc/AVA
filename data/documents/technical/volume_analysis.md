# Volume Analysis: The Hidden Truth Behind Price

## Why Volume Matters

Volume is the fuel that drives price movement. Price tells you WHAT happened; volume tells you HOW SIGNIFICANT it was. Professional traders pay as much attention to volume as price.

**Core principle**: Volume precedes price.

## Volume Basics

### What is Volume?

```
Definition:
The number of shares (or contracts) traded during a period

For stocks: Shares exchanged
For options: Contracts traded
For futures: Contracts traded
```

### Average Volume

```
Calculation:
Average daily volume = Sum of last N days' volume / N
Commonly used: 10, 20, or 50-day average

Significance:
- Establishes baseline "normal" trading
- Deviations from average are significant
- Higher than average = institutional interest
```

### Relative Volume (RVOL)

```
Formula:
RVOL = Current Volume / Average Volume

Interpretation:
0.5 RVOL: Half normal volume (quiet)
1.0 RVOL: Normal volume
1.5 RVOL: 50% above normal
2.0 RVOL: Double normal (significant)
3.0+ RVOL: Triple+ normal (major event)
```

## Volume and Price Relationship

### Volume Confirms Trend

**Healthy Uptrend**:
```
Price rising + Volume rising = Strong trend
- Buyers are aggressive
- New money entering
- Trend likely to continue
```

**Unhealthy Uptrend**:
```
Price rising + Volume falling = Weak trend
- Buyers exhausted
- Fewer participants
- Trend may be ending
```

**Healthy Downtrend**:
```
Price falling + Volume rising = Strong selling
- Sellers aggressive
- Capitulation possible
- Trend continues
```

**Potential Bottom**:
```
Price falling + Volume falling = Selling exhausted
- Sellers done
- Watch for reversal signs
- Accumulation may begin
```

## Key Volume Patterns

### Volume Spikes

```
Definition: Volume 2x+ normal

Bullish spike:
- High volume + price up + close near high
- Strong buying interest
- Often marks trend continuation

Bearish spike:
- High volume + price down + close near low
- Strong selling pressure
- Often marks trend continuation

Reversal spike:
- High volume + long tail/wick
- Exhaustion of one side
- Watch for reversal
```

### Volume Dry-Up

```
Definition: Volume drops significantly below average

After uptrend:
- Buyers exhausted
- Potential top forming
- Wait for confirmation

After downtrend:
- Sellers exhausted
- Potential bottom forming
- Accumulation may begin

In consolidation:
- Low interest
- Breakout coming
- Watch for volume expansion
```

### Climax Volume

```
Definition: Extreme volume at extreme prices

Buying climax:
- Highest volume of move
- Gap up, blow-off top
- Often marks the high
- Don't chase

Selling climax:
- Highest volume of decline
- Gap down, panic selling
- Often marks the low
- Opportunity for brave
```

## Volume Patterns for Options Trading

### Pre-Breakout Accumulation

```
Pattern:
1. Price consolidating in range
2. Volume declining (coiling)
3. Sudden volume spike
4. Breakout with follow-through

Options application:
- Prepare before breakout
- Enter on breakout with volume confirmation
- Direction of break determines strategy
```

### Distribution Pattern

```
Pattern:
1. Price at highs after long uptrend
2. High volume but price can't advance
3. Wide price swings
4. Eventually breaks down

Options application:
- Avoid buying calls at this stage
- Consider bear call spreads
- Wait for clear breakdown
```

### Accumulation Pattern

```
Pattern:
1. Price at lows after decline
2. Volume increases but price doesn't drop more
3. Higher lows forming
4. Eventually breaks out

Options application:
- Good time for CSPs
- Watch for breakout entry
- Bull put spreads work well
```

## Volume Indicators

### On-Balance Volume (OBV)

```
Calculation:
If close > prior close: OBV = Prior OBV + Volume
If close < prior close: OBV = Prior OBV - Volume

Interpretation:
- OBV rising with price = confirmed uptrend
- OBV falling with price = confirmed downtrend
- OBV diverging from price = warning sign
```

**OBV Divergences**:
```
Bullish divergence:
Price making lower lows
OBV making higher lows
= Accumulation, potential reversal

Bearish divergence:
Price making higher highs
OBV making lower highs
= Distribution, potential reversal
```

### Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

```
Calculation:
VWAP = Cumulative(Price × Volume) / Cumulative(Volume)

Use:
- Intraday benchmark
- Institutional execution target
- Support/resistance

Trading:
- Price above VWAP = bullish intraday
- Price below VWAP = bearish intraday
- VWAP acts as magnet
```

### Volume Profile

```
Shows volume at each price level

Key elements:
- Point of Control (POC): Highest volume price
- Value Area: 70% of volume range
- High Volume Nodes: Support/resistance
- Low Volume Nodes: Price moves quickly through

Application:
- Trade from LVN to HVN
- HVN acts as S/R
- POC is fair value
```

## Volume in Different Market Contexts

### Options Volume Analysis

```
Option-specific volume metrics:

Open Interest: Total outstanding contracts
Volume: Contracts traded today

High volume + increasing OI = New positions
High volume + decreasing OI = Closing positions

Put/Call ratio:
PCR < 0.7 = Bullish sentiment
PCR 0.7-1.0 = Neutral
PCR > 1.0 = Bearish sentiment
```

### Volume Around Events

```
Before earnings:
- Volume typically increases
- Implied volatility rises
- Options volume spikes

After earnings:
- Volume spikes on report
- IV crashes
- Direction set for near-term

Before/After FOMC:
- Volume often light before
- Spikes during announcement
- Direction clarifies after
```

### Volume and Gaps

```
Gap up with high volume:
- Strong bullish signal
- Trend likely continues
- Don't fade immediately

Gap up with low volume:
- Potentially weak gap
- May fill quickly
- Less conviction

Gap down with high volume:
- Panic or legitimate selling
- Watch for climax bottom
- May present opportunity

Gap down with low volume:
- May fill quickly
- Less conviction
- Wait for confirmation
```

## Practical Volume Trading Rules

### Rule 1: Never Ignore Volume on Breakouts

```
Valid breakout:
- Volume at least 1.5x average
- Preferably 2x+ average
- Closes strong (near highs/lows)

Suspect breakout:
- Volume at or below average
- May be false breakout
- Wait for confirmation
```

### Rule 2: Volume Divergence = Warning

```
If price and volume diverge:
- Trend may be weakening
- Don't add to positions
- Tighten stops
- Prepare for reversal
```

### Rule 3: Low Volume = No Conviction

```
Low volume moves:
- Often reverse
- Don't trust them
- Require confirmation
- Poor time for new positions
```

### Rule 4: Climax Volume Requires Respect

```
When you see climax volume:
- Don't fight it
- Expect reversal potential
- Wait 2-3 days before acting
- Often marks turning points
```

## Volume Analysis Checklist

□ What do volume patterns suggest?
□ Is this a high or low conviction setup?

## Common Volume Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Volume Entirely

```
Wrong: Only looking at price
Right: Always check volume with price

Volume provides context
Price without volume is incomplete
```

### Mistake 2: Trading Low Volume Breakouts

```
Wrong: Buying every breakout
Right: Requiring volume confirmation

Low volume breakouts often fail
Be patient for real moves
```

### Mistake 3: Misinterpreting Volume

```
Wrong: High volume always bullish
Right: Volume shows conviction, not direction

High volume down = bearish conviction
Context matters more than absolute volume
```

### Mistake 4: Using Volume in Isolation

```
Wrong: Trading solely on volume signals
Right: Using volume to confirm other analysis

Volume is a confirmation tool
Not a standalone signal
```

## Conclusion

Volume analysis reveals the conviction behind price moves. It's the difference between a meaningful trend and noise.

**Key principles**:
1. Volume confirms trends - rising price needs rising volume
2. Divergences warn of potential reversals
3. Breakouts need volume to be valid
4. Climax volume often marks turning points
5. Low volume moves are unreliable
6. Use volume to filter, not to initiate

**Remember**: Price gets the headlines, but volume tells the truth. The best trades have both price and volume in agreement.
