# Support and Resistance: The Foundation of Technical Analysis

## What Are Support and Resistance?

Support and resistance are price levels where buying or selling pressure is strong enough to halt or reverse price movement. They are the most fundamental concepts in technical analysis.

## Support

### Definition

Support is a price level where buying pressure exceeds selling pressure, causing the price to stop falling and potentially reverse upward.

### Why Support Forms

```
Psychological factors:
1. Buyers see value at the price level
2. Short sellers take profits
3. Previous buyers defend their positions
4. Round numbers attract orders
5. Institutional accumulation zones
```

### Types of Support

**Horizontal Support**:
```
Price has bounced from same level multiple times
More touches = stronger support
Works in any market condition
```

**Trend Line Support**:
```
Diagonal line connecting higher lows
Valid in uptrends
Requires at least 2 touches
```

**Moving Average Support**:
```
Common levels: 20, 50, 200-day MA
Price tends to bounce off these
More significant in strong trends
```

## Resistance

### Definition

Resistance is a price level where selling pressure exceeds buying pressure, causing the price to stop rising and potentially reverse downward.

### Why Resistance Forms

```
Psychological factors:
1. Sellers see overvaluation
2. Long holders take profits
3. Previous losers exit at breakeven
4. Round numbers attract orders
5. Institutional distribution zones
```

### Types of Resistance

**Horizontal Resistance**:
```
Price has rejected from same level multiple times
Historical highs act as resistance
Previous support becomes resistance when broken
```

**Trend Line Resistance**:
```
Diagonal line connecting lower highs
Valid in downtrends
Requires at least 2 touches
```

**Moving Average Resistance**:
```
Price struggles to break above MA
Common at 50 and 200-day MA
Particularly strong in downtrends
```

## Identifying Strong Levels

### Multiple Touches

```
Strength by touches:
2 touches: Weak level
3 touches: Moderate level
4+ touches: Strong level

The more times tested, the more significant the level
BUT: Eventually all levels break
```

### Volume Confirmation

```
Strong support/resistance:
- High volume at the level
- Volume spikes on tests
- Volume climax on breaks

Weak support/resistance:
- Low volume formation
- Little volume on tests
- Breaks on low volume (often fail)
```

### Time Frame Significance

```
Higher time frame = More significant

Daily support > 4-hour support > 1-hour support

Weekly/Monthly levels most reliable
Intraday levels less reliable
```

### Round Numbers

```
Psychological levels:
$100, $150, $200 (major)
$105, $110, $115 (minor)

These naturally attract orders
Often combine with technical levels
```

## Support Becomes Resistance (and Vice Versa)

### The Polarity Principle

```
When support breaks:
- Support becomes resistance
- Failed longs sell at breakeven
- Creates natural resistance

When resistance breaks:
- Resistance becomes support
- New buyers defend breakout price
- Creates natural support
```

### Trading the Flip

```
After support breaks:
1. Wait for price to rally back to old support
2. Look for rejection (bearish candles)
3. Enter short with stop above resistance
4. Target next support below

After resistance breaks:
1. Wait for price to pull back to old resistance
2. Look for bounce (bullish candles)
3. Enter long with stop below support
4. Target next resistance above
```

## Zone vs Line

### Why Zones Work Better

```
Support is rarely an exact price
Better to think in zones:
- $98-$100 support zone
- $148-$152 resistance zone

Zone accounts for:
- Intraday volatility
- Different traders' interpretations
- Market maker manipulation
```

### Defining Zone Width

```
For stocks:
Zone width = 1-3% of price
$100 stock: $99-$101 zone

For indices/ETFs:
Zone width = 0.5-1% of price
$450 SPY: $447-$453 zone
```

## Using Support/Resistance for Options

### Strike Selection

**For Cash-Secured Puts**:
```
Sell puts AT or BELOW strong support
If support holds, put expires worthless
If support breaks, you buy at discount to previous support

Example:
Stock at $105
Strong support at $100
Sell $100 or $95 put
```

**For Covered Calls**:
```
Sell calls AT or ABOVE strong resistance
If resistance holds, keep shares + premium
If broken, sell at good price + premium

Example:
Stock at $95
Strong resistance at $100
Sell $100 or $105 call
```

### Stop Placement

```
Long options:
Stop just below support (give 1-2% cushion)

Short options:
Mental stop if support breaks decisively
```

## Breakouts and Breakdowns

### Valid Breakouts

```
Signs of a valid breakout:
1. High volume (1.5x+ average)
2. Closes above/below level (not just wick)
3. Follow-through in next session
4. Retest holds the level

Suspect breakouts:
1. Low volume
2. Wick-only above/below
3. Quick reversal
4. Prior trend exhaustion
```

### False Breakouts

```
Common characteristics:
1. Occurs on low volume
2. Quick reversal (within 2-3 bars)
3. No follow-through
4. Happens at obvious levels

Trading false breakouts:
- Wait for confirmation before acting
- Use the false break as entry in opposite direction
```

### Measuring Breakout Targets

```
Measured move technique:
Target = Breakout Point + (High - Low of range)

Example:
Range: $95-$105
Breakout above $105
Target: $105 + ($105-$95) = $115
```

## Practical Application

### Finding Key Levels

```
Step-by-step process:

1. Zoom out to weekly/monthly chart
2. Identify major highs and lows
3. Mark horizontal lines at these levels
4. Note where price consolidated
5. Zoom to daily for refinement
6. Draw zones around key prices
```

### Level Significance Checklist

```
For each level, check:
□ How many touches? (more = stronger)
□ How much volume at level? (more = stronger)
□ Is it a round number?
□ Does it appear on multiple time frames?
□ Is there confluence with other indicators?
□ How recent? (recent = more relevant)
```

### Sample Analysis

```
Stock: XYZ at $97

Key Levels Identified:
- $100: Major resistance (5 touches, round number, 50-day MA)
- $95: Minor support (2 touches, recent low)
- $90: Major support (4 touches, high volume, weekly level)
- $105: Secondary resistance (previous breakout point)

Trading Plan:
- Bullish above $100 with volume
- Neutral $95-$100
- Bearish below $95
- Strong buy at $90 zone
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Exact Price Focus

```
Wrong: Support at exactly $100.00
Right: Support zone $99.50-$100.50

Allow for normal variation
```

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Trend

```
Support in downtrend = Likely to break
Resistance in uptrend = Likely to break

Trade WITH the trend, not against it
```

### Mistake 3: Too Many Lines

```
Wrong: 10+ lines on a chart
Right: 2-3 most significant levels

Focus on major levels only
```

### Mistake 4: Static Analysis

```
Wrong: Setting levels and forgetting
Right: Updating as new data arrives

Markets evolve, levels change
```

### Mistake 5: Anticipating Breaks

```
Wrong: "It'll break this time"
Right: Wait for actual break with confirmation

Don't predict, react
```

## Integration with Options Strategies

### Wheel Strategy Integration

```
For CSPs:
1. Identify strong support
2. Sell put at or below support
3. Support = defense for your position

For Covered Calls:
1. Identify strong resistance
2. Sell call at or above resistance
3. Resistance = natural exit point
```

### Entry Timing

```
Buy options:
- Near support (calls) or resistance (puts)
- Stop just beyond the level
- Favorable risk/reward

Sell options:
- Strike at support (puts) or resistance (calls)
- Let support/resistance protect you
```

## Quick Reference

### Support Trading Rules

```
1. Buy at support, not before
2. Stop goes below support (with cushion)
3. Target is next resistance
4. Stronger support = higher confidence
5. Broken support = new resistance
```

### Resistance Trading Rules

```
1. Sell at resistance, not before
2. Stop goes above resistance (with cushion)
3. Target is next support
4. Stronger resistance = higher confidence
5. Broken resistance = new support
```

## Conclusion

Support and resistance are the building blocks of technical analysis. Master these concepts before moving to complex indicators.

**Key takeaways**:
1. Think in zones, not lines
2. More touches = stronger level
3. Volume confirms significance
4. Support becomes resistance (and vice versa)
5. Always trade with trend context
6. Use levels for options strike selection

When in doubt, wait for confirmation. The level isn't meaningful until it proves itself.
